Hi! Welcome to the github organization of the ROS aerial robotics community working group!

We aim to have monthly meetings, with a project presentation and to facilitate discussions. These will be announced on [ROS Discourse](https://discourse.ros.org/c/aerial-vehicles/14) and the [ROS community google calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=c_3fc5c4d6ece9d80d49f136c1dcd54d7f44e1acefdbe87228c92ff268e85e2ea0%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=UTC).

We mostly communicate on the Aerial Vehicles Discourse category: https://discourse.ros.org/c/aerial-vehicles. Also we have a seperate channel on the Open Robotics Discord channel called #cwg-aerial for any lightweight announcements and chats.
